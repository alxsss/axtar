            $cal->setPastLimit("2010-01-01");
            
            //Force user to select a date smaller than 2011-01-01 (Optional)
            $cal->setFutureLimit("2011-01-01");
            
            //We save the calendar class to session (To be used in ajax navigation of months and years)
            $cal->save($this->getUser());
            
            //We pass on the calendar to the template
            $this->cal = $cal;
            
  * Use calendar in template:

            [php]

            <!-- Generate the date picker input field -->
            <!-- The parameter represents the name & id of the input field generated -->
            <?=$cal->RenderAjax("mydate")?>
            
  * It generated a input field and a button. Once the button was clicked or the input field was clicked, the calendar will appear.
